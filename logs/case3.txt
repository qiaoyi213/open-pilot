USING SAGETEX
The SageTeX package allows you to embed the results of Sage computations into a LaTeX document. To use it, you will
need to “install” it first (see Make SageTeX known to TeX).
7.1 An example
Here is a very brief example of using SageTeX. The full documentation can be found in SAGE_ROOT/venv/share/
doc/sagetex, where SAGE_ROOT is the directory where your Sage installation is located. That directory contains the
documentation and an example file. See SAGE_ROOT/venv/share/texmf/tex/latex/sagetex for some possibly
useful Python scripts.
To see how SageTeX works, follow the directions for installing SageTeX (in Make SageTeX known to TeX) and copy the
following text into a file named, say, st_example.tex:

CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 1.02
Note that GAP and Maxima are the slowest in this test (this was run on the machine sage.math.washington.edu).
Because of the pexpect interface overhead, it is perhaps unfair to compare these to Sage, which is the fastest.
3.5 Other IPython tricks
As noted above, Sage uses IPython as its front end, and so you can use any of IPython’s commands and features. You
can read the full IPython documentation. Meanwhile, here are some fun tricks – these are called “Magic commands” in
IPython:
• You can use %edit (or %ed or ed) to open an editor, if you want to type in some complex code. Before you
start Sage, make sure that the EDITOR environment variable is set to your favorite editor (by putting export
EDITOR=/usr/bin/emacs or export EDITOR=/usr/bin/vim or something similar in the appropriate place,
like a .profile file). From the Sage prompt, executing %edit will open up the named editor. Then within the
editor you can define a function:
def some_function(n):
return n**2 + 3*n + 2
Save and quit from the editor. For the rest of your Sage session, you can then use some_function. If you want
to modify it, type %edit some_function from the Sage prompt.
• If you have a computation and you want to modify its output for another use, perform the computation and type
%rep: this will place the output from the previous command at the Sage prompt, ready for you to edit it.
sage: f(x) = cos(x)
sage: f(x).derivative(x)
-sin(x)
>>> from sage.all import *
>>> __tmp__=var("x"); f = symbolic_expression(cos(x)).function(x)
>>> f(x).derivative(x)
-sin(x)
At this point, if you type %rep at the Sage prompt, you will get a new Sage prompt, followed by -sin(x), with
the cursor at the end of the line.
For more, type %quickref to get a quick reference guide to IPython. As of this writing (April 2011), Sage uses version
0.9.1 of IPython, and the documentation for its magic commands is available online. Various slightly advanced aspects
of magic command system are documented here in IPython.
3.6 Errors and Exceptions
When something goes wrong, you will usually see a Python “exception”. Python even tries to suggest what raised the
exception. Often you see the name of the exception, e.g., NameError or ValueError (see the Python Library Reference
[PyLR] for a complete list of exceptions). For example,

def some_function(n):
return n**2 + 3*n + 2
Save and quit from the editor. For the rest of your Sage session, you can then use some_function. If you want
to modify it, type %edit some_function from the Sage prompt.
• If you have a computation and you want to modify its output for another use, perform the computation and type
%rep: this will place the output from the previous command at the Sage prompt, ready for you to edit it.
sage: f(x) = cos(x)
sage: f(x).derivative(x)
-sin(x)
>>> from sage.all import *
>>> __tmp__=var("x"); f = symbolic_expression(cos(x)).function(x)
>>> f(x).derivative(x)
-sin(x)
At this point, if you type %rep at the Sage prompt, you will get a new Sage prompt, followed by -sin(x), with
the cursor at the end of the line.
For more, type %quickref to get a quick reference guide to IPython. As of this writing (April 2011), Sage uses version
0.9.1 of IPython, and the documentation for its magic commands is available online. Various slightly advanced aspects
of magic command system are documented here in IPython.
3.6 Errors and Exceptions
When something goes wrong, you will usually see a Python “exception”. Python even tries to suggest what raised the
exception. Often you see the name of the exception, e.g., NameError or ValueError (see the Python Library Reference
[PyLR] for a complete list of exceptions). For example,
